# DMPTY
Code Repository for the Data Management Plan Wizard

The implementation is based upon angularjs and related packages. It contains the entire site
allowing users to fill out a number of web forms whose content is the basis of a data management
plan generated in plain text, rtf or word.

DMPTY uses pandoc, see pandoc.org, to convert files from html to RTF, WORD, or LaTeX.
You need to install pandoc on your local server system. The folder cgi-bin of the DMPTY distribution holds Perl
scripts that need to be copied in the respective cgi-bin directory of your web server. Adapt the paths used as
approporiate for your local system!

If you make use of the DMPTY code, please drop us a note. Thanks!
