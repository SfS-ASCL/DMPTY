<h3>Data Selection</h3>
<p>
  Please specify which data must be retained and which must be deleted in order to satisfy contractual or legal obligations. All data essential to the reproducibility of research results should be retained. Data which could be relevant to future studies should also be retained. Please give a short description of the criteria for the data selection.
</p>

  <label for="dataSelection">Data selection</label>

<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>
  Quality assurance is important for the long term storage of the data.  For example,  it is important to ensure the readability of OCR data, the interpretability of scans, the validity of program code, etc. The strategies used for quality assurance that the project will follow and who is responsible for quality assurance must be clearly described in the data management plan.
</p>


<div class="form-group">
  <label for="qualityAssurance"></label>
  <textarea rows="10" class="form-control" name="qualityAssurance" ng-model="formData.qualityAssurance" placeholder="The data created during the project will be reviewed by at least two people involved in the project before archiving. 

or

The OCR data were independently reviewed manually by two people. 

or

The digitalization was carried out using a double keying process. 

or

The publication for which the data was produced was blind reviewed.

or

The version of this resource was created from a correct previous version.">
  </textarea>
</div>

<p>
  In the area of quality assurance, CLARIN-D can only help with the data formats used. All other aspects of quality assurance are the responsibility of the project provider.
</p>

<h3>Data Organization</h3>
<p>
  For data organization, the granularity of the data to be stored is a complex problem. It is important to be able to split the data into meaningful digital objects that must later be consolidated and searchable. What a meaningful digital object is, however, depends on the context of the data.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a single poem or article can be a meaningful digital object for a literary analysis. On the other hand, many yearsâ€™ worth of newspaper articles are gathered in linguistic corpora. In this example, the whole corpus is a meaningful digital unit, but not its individual components.
</p>
<p>
  The provider must clearly discuss the question of granularity in the data management plan. It must be clearly stated what the digital objects in the raw data are and what their granularity is.
</p>

<div class="form-group">
  <label for="dataOrgGranularity">Granularity</label>
  <textarea rows="10" class="form-control" name="dataOrgGranularity" ng-model="formData.dataOrgGranularity"
	    placeholder="Every digital object corresponds to one publication in a journal. 

or

Every digital object corresponds to a standard reference source, such as a treebank, a lexical databank, etc.

or 
                     
Every digital object corresponds to an experiment.
