 <h3>Ethics and Privacy</h3>
<p>
  If test subjects are involved in the project, you must clarify whether and how the data will be anonymized and whether the data need special protection on the grounds of personality rights. <br />
 In general, CLARIN centers only accept anonymized data or data, where the test subject has clearly stated his/her approval of their publication for use in scientific research. In the latter case, the process for obtaining permission for using the data and documenting the permission agreement must be described.

<p>
  In principal, CLARIN only accepts data which are accessible and intended for free use for academic purposes, because these data can easily be published and distributed. When distribution for academic purposes is not possible, further agreements must be reached with the repository operators. Such limitations should already be considered at the time of the creation of the data management plan. 
Such limitations can occur for example, when personal rights are involved, when the copyright for raw data belongs to a third party and cannot be obtained, or when there is a time window for scientific use.
