    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship between the previously existing data and the new data produced in the project is the following: {{ formData.dataRel || "(Relationship)"}}.
    </p>

    <!-- Documentation and metadata -->
    <h3>Documentation and description with metadata</h3>
    <p>
      The research data will be documented in the following way in order to facilitate reproducibility of the project results and to enable their reuse in further studies:
      {{ formData.dataDocumentation || "(Documentation of the data)" }}
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the CLARIN-D framework, the metadata are described according to the CMDI-Framework (ISO 24622-1:2015). The following metadata profiles will be used as a basis for the description: 

      {{ formData.metadataDesc || "(Metadata description)" }}

    <!-- Ethics and Legal Complicance -->
    <h3>Ethics, data protection, and other legal provisions</h3>
    <p>
      {{ formData.ethicsPrivacy || "(Ethics and data protection declaration)" }}
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If third parties are involved in the project, consent forms from informants and test subjects will be documented, and the documentation will be electronically archived.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CLARIN-D center will obtain the non-exclusive usage and publication rights of the data produced in the project titled {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project)" }} 
      with the previously named  restrictions. In particular, the CLARIN-D center has copyright of the project titled {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project)" }}, as well as all of the obligations, especially those regarding  the rights of third parties to the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particular to the copyright and usage rights in this project is the following:

      {{ formData.licence || "(License declaration)" }} 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The data produced shall be made available for scientific research with the following stipulations:
      {{ formData.dataLicence || "(License for the research data)" }}.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The data transfer shall occur in accordance with a data transfer contract to be agreed upon by the data producer and the CLARIN-D center. 
    </p>

    <!-- Storage and Backup     -->
    <h3>Data storage throughout project duration</h3>
    The research data will be stored in the following way throughout the project duration: 
    
    {{ formData.storage || "(Data storage and backup)"}}.

    It will be ensured that only authorized people have access to the project research data in the following way: 
    
    {{ formData.accessPolicy || "(Data access)" }}
    
    <!-- Selection and preservation -->
    <h3>Data selection, quality assurance, organization and preservation</h3>

    <p>
      The data for reuse and archiving will be selected in the following way:

      {{ formData.dataSelection || "(Description of the data selection)" }}
    </p>

    <p>
      The digital objects will be subject to a quality assurance process before delivery. The process can be described in the following manner:

      {{ formData.qualityAssurance || "(Description of the quality assurance)" }}
    </p>

    <p>
      The data are consolidated into units that are suitable for individual transfer. These are stored as separate digital objects. In the case of the data produced in the project {{ formData.projectName }}  the following units are foreseen: 

      {{ formData.dataOrgGranularity || "(Data granularity)" }}
    </p>

    <p>
      It is expected that in the project {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project" }}, {{ formData.dataOrgNumber || "(Number of data)" }} with the total size {{ formData.dataOrgSize || "(Size of the data)" }} will be created and archived.
    </p>

    <p>
    The metadata for the selected research data will be created by {{ formData.metadataProducer }}.

    The CLARIN-D center {{ formData.archivar || "(CLARIN-D Center)"}} will undertake the archiving of the data. 

    The contact person at the CLARIN center is {{ formData.clarinContact || "(CLARIN-D contact)" }}.

    The following CLARIN-D center supports the data transfer: {{ formData.archiveSupport || "(Support)" }}.
    
    <!-- Data sharing -->
    <h3>Access to research data</h3>
    <p>
      At the time of creation of this contract, it is foreseen that especially the following groups of people shall have long term access to the data:
      <ul>
	<li>Participants in the project {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project)" }}</li>
	<li>Certain reviewers from the project sponsors and participating institutions</li>
	<li>As well as the target group: {{ formData.targetGroup || "(Target group)" }}</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      The CLARIN-D center lists the metadata description of the research data in the search catalog so that potential users can easily find the data.

      The data will be made available to interested people through the CLARIN-D center. The CLARIN-D center makes the digital objects available with a persistent identifier.

    </p>

    <!-- Responsibilities and Resources -->
    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>
      The following expenses are expected for data management:

      <ul>
	<li>Creation of the metadata description {{ formData.metadataBudget || "(Budget for creation of metadata)" }}  hours per description.
</li>
	
	<li>For the storage of the data {{ budgetDatasize || "(Budget for data storage)"}} and the corresponding data backup, an expenditure of {{ formData.budgetOverall || "(Total budget)" }} is expected.</li>
      </ul>
	<p>  
      Thus, an amount of {{ formData.budgetOverall || "(Total budget)" }} is expected for data management in the project {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project)" }}, of which the CLARIN-D center "{{ formData.archivarRealName || "(CLARIN-D Center)" }}" receives {{ formData.budgetClarinDZentrum || "(Budget for the CLARIN-D center)" }}.

    </p>

    <!-- Extra heading for time schedule -->
    <h3>Time frame</h3>
    <p>
      The project {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project)" }} will make the data available on {{ (formData.dataIngest | date: 'longDate') || "(Date of upload)" }}  to the CLARIN-D center "{{ formData.archivarRealName || "(CLARIN-D Center)" in an appropriate medium or by direct upload.
    </p>

    <p>
      The description of the data will be provided on {{ (formData.metadataProductionDate | date: 'longDate') || "(Date of metadata creation)" }} by {{ formData.metadataProducer || "(Creator of the metadata)"}} to the CLARIN-D center "{{ formData.archivarRealName || "(CLARIN-D Center)"}}".
    </p>

    <p>
      The data from {{ formData.projectName || "(Name of the project)"}} should in the spirit of good scientific practice be available from {{ (formData.serviceFrom | date: 'longDate') || "(Date of first availability)" }} until at least {{ (formData.serviceMin | date:'longDate') || "(Minimum last availability date)" }}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientific community should have access to the data for reuse from {{ (formData.dataPubWiss | date:'longDate') || "(Date of first availability for the scientific community)" }}. The general public should have access to the data for reuse from {{ (formData.dataPub | date:'longDate') || "(Date of first availability for the general public)" }} .
    </p>

    <p>
      <small><em>If not applicable, please remove.</em></small>
