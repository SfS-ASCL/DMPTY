      <h1>DMPTY: Management of Research Data</h1>

      <p>
          Good scientific practice includes careful treatment of research data. Data support scientific arguments, they allow other scientists to reproduce established results or to gain new insights by building off of them.
      </p>
      <p>
          The success of a research project is not measured only by the number and relevance of scientific publications, but also through the quality of the data that it is based on. Therefore, research data should also be acceptably "published" (i.e. described with metadata) and "archived" (i.e. stored in a repository). Research funding institutions such as the DFG argue in favor of a minimum storage time of at least 10 years after the end of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
          Research projects from the humanities and social sciences that deal with language data can find support for the management of their data in the research infrastucture CLARIN. CLARIN offers methods and tools for the description and archiving of databases. It also offers access to archived research data in accordance with the corresponding access rights and licenses.
      </p>
      <p>
          By working with CLARIN, you show your willingness right from the application process to handle the archiving and reuse of your data on a sustainable basis.
